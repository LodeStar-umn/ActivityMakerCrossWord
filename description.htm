<h2>ActivityMaker</h2>
<p>ActivityMaker provides the largest variety of activity types, but doesn't support smart phones. Use ActivityMaker Mobile for projects that will adjust to any device size. Eventually, Activity Mobile will support all of the activity types that (Classic) ActivityMaker currently supports.</p>
<p>With ActivityMaker, you can build simple presentations, case studies, troubleshooting workflows, etc. With ActivityMaker, you can easily add assessment items that include flash cards, crosswords, challenge games, categorization, matching, short answer questions, multiple choice, multiple select, click/touch and true and false.</p>
